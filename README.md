# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to research ideal vacation spots for our client, and to provide a recommendation and itenary for the final destination(s).

## Weather Database

To initiate the analysis, a random set of 2,000 latitudes and longitudes were generated, and an API call was made on current weather data for the nearest corresponding cities. From this dataset, we were able to retreive data for 760 unique locations and further evaluate the weather including:
- Max temperature
